## Abstract
The fundamental operations of calculus have a simple geometric meaning: differentiation is *folding* (compressing global information to local slope), and integration is *unfolding* (expanding local slopes into global structure). At a 90-degree crease (e.g., f(x) = |x| at x=0), folding reveals a set of possible slopes rather than a single number. This reframing makes creases central rather than exceptional and directly illuminates ReLU neural networks as layered folding machines. We formalize the framework, introduce crease density as a diagnostic, and present supporting experiments.

## 1. The 90-Degree Fold — The Core Intuition
(Insert image from PDF: title/cover page or Chapter 1 screenshot here)

Consider the graph of **f(x) = |x|** — two straight lines meeting at a sharp **90-degree crease** at x=0.

- **Folding at the crease**: Press the left and right arms flat together. All global shape information collapses to the local possibilities at the hinge: any supporting line with slope m where -1 ≤ m ≤ 1. This set *is* the subdifferential ∂f(0) = [-1, 1].
- **Unfolding**: Take local slopes and integrate them. You recover piecewise linear functions consistent with the original crease.

This is exact mathematics. For smooth functions (no sharp crease, e.g. x²), the fold yields a single tangent slope. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that fold and unfold are inverses.

## 2. Formal Definitions
- **Fold (Differentiation)**: Maps a function to its local linear approximations.
- **Unfold (Integration)**: Reconstructs the global function from local approximations.
- **Crease**: Point where the subdifferential is an interval (positive diameter) rather than a singleton.
- **Crease Density**: Fraction of ReLU pre-activations near zero in a neural network (quantifies undecided folds).

## 3. ReLU Networks as Layered Folding
Each ReLU layer applies a 90-degree-style fold along a hyperplane. Deeper networks perform more folds, creating complex decision boundaries. Crease density tracks how many units remain at their switching hinges during training.

## 4. Experiments & Results
(Summarized from provided PDF — small but consistent effects on toy problems. Crease density drops as networks settle their folds.)

## 5. Discussion & Open Problems
The 90-degree fold provides a unifying geometric language. Future work: formal fold depth complexity, soft creases for modern activations, and applications in geometry.
